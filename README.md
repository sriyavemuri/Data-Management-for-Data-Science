# Data-Management-for-Data-Science
Projects from my time in CS210, a class that was a brief introduction to data science using Python, numPy, pandas, RedEx, and mySQL.

Below is an in-depth description of the purposes of the projects.
## Movie Recommendation System
Given text files with a list of movies, the genre the movies fall under, and the ratings given for the movies by different viewers, the program will read and process the data. Then, it will recommend top rated movies, given parameters of a threshold rating/specified genre. The program also shows the top movies for each viewer/reviewer, and their top genres.
## Pokemon, COVID, and Text Processing
Processing and cleaning data in CSV files using python, **without** numPy or pandas imported.
## EU Cities Temperatures, German Credit, Google Playstore Apps
Processing, cleaning, and analyzing data in CSV files using numPy and Pandas in Jupyter Notebooks. Then, visualizing analysis using matplotlib.
## Music Relational Database
Designing a relational database that organizes music data, including artists, albums, songs, users, playlists, and ratings. Then, utilizing queries to find specific information in the database, like top genres and most common songs in playlists. The framework for the relational database is on a txt file, as we utilized mySQL installed on iLab machines.
